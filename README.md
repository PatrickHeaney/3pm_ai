# The Start

The **Vision** of this 3pm_ai open source software project is to continually raise the bar of value creation through project, program, portfolio, and all forms of agile best practices by leveraging the benefits of artificial intelligence, unbounded to a  proprietary solution.

The **Mission** of this 3pm_ai open source software project is to empower managers and leaders with job security by empowering them prompt engineering skills, i.e. better questions, to create agentic AI agents to help them realize their vision. 

The **Strategy** of this 3pm_ai open source software project follows a series of increments and interations that foster the trust and knowledge needed to acheive this mission.  Each increment has a specific goal, each iteration is the users specific a learning experience to achieve that goal.  

# Increments

## Increment 1: The Core Conversation Loop (Complete)
**The goal** of this increment is to establish and learn your own python development environment and process by recreating a basic conversation loop with any AI agent of your choosing.  By completing this increment the AI developer will 
  1. Create a system prompt for their AI coding assistant
  2. Learn the IDEA.md -> PLANNING.md -> TASK.md -> README.md -> Code -> Unit test -> user test -> PLAN
  3. create and start an AI Agent with a terminal UI,
  4. have a basic conversation with the agent (no tools, no memory), and the agent will respond using the LLM.
